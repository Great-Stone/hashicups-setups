## Introduction 

HashiCups is a coffee order management system for fictional customers. 
The HashiCups application is only used for demonstration purposes, such as tutorials, webinars, and demos.
HashiCups was designed in a microservices architecture with the intent to help you showcase the strength of HashiCorp products.

This tutorial will provide you with an overview of the HashiCups architecture and a better understand of the services that makeup HashiCups.


## Architecture

Each service depends on another service, as a result, all services must be deployed to have a functional HashiCups application.
